# House-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning project predicting California housing prices with XGBoost regression model.

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using the well-known California Housing dataset.
It implements an XGBoost regression model, which is a powerful gradient boosting technique, to provide accurate
price predictions based on multiple housing features.

## Key Features
- Loads and preprocesses the California Housing dataset using Pandas and NumPy
- Explores feature correlations with visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Splits data into training and testing sets for unbiased model evaluation
- Builds and trains an XGBoost regression model
- Evaluates performance with RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted housing prices on the training dataset
